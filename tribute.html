            Joseph Fraunhofer was the 11th child, born into a Roman Catholic
            family in Straubing, in the Electorate of Bavaria, to Franz Xaver
            Fraunhofer and Maria Anna Fr√∂hlich. He was orphaned at the age of 11
            and started working as an apprentice to a harsh glassmaker named
            Philipp Anton Weichelsberger. In 1801, the workshop in which he was
            working collapsed, and he was buried in the rubble. The rescue
            operation was led by Prince-Elector Maximilian Joseph. The prince
            entered Fraunhofer's life, providing him with books and forcing his
            employer to allow the young Fraunhofer time to study. <br />
            This is a rather inspiring story.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In 1806, he discovered how to make fine optical glass and invented
              precise methods for measuring optical dispersion.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              By 1809, the mechanical part of the Optical Institute was chiefly
              under Fraunhofer's direction, and Fraunhofer became one of the
              members of the firm that same year.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In 1814, Guinand became a partner with Fraunhofer in the firm, and
              the name was changed to Utzschneider-und-Fraunhofer.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              During 1818, Fraunhofer became the director of the Optical
              Institute. Due to the fine optical instruments developed by
              Fraunhofer, Bavaria overtook England as the center of the optics
              industry. Even the likes of Michael Faraday were unable to produce
              glass that could rival Fraunhofer.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In 1822, Frauhofer earned an honorar doctorate from the University
              of Erlangen.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In 1824, Fraunhofer was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit
              of the Bavarian Crown by King Maximilian I, through which he was
              raised into personal nobility (with the title "Ritter von", i.e.
              knight). The same year, he was also made an honorary citizen of
              Munich.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            He was poisoned by heavy metal vapors, resulting in his premature
            death. Fraunhofer died in 1826 at the age of 39. His most valuable
            glassmaking recipes are thought to have gone to the grave with him.
